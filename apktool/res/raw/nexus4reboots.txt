Dear Nexus 4 user,

Recently, you may have experienced device restarts while using Snapchat. Unfortunately, this behavior is caused by a bug in the Nexus 4 Android operating system and is out of Snapchat's control. If you would like to let Google know that this issue is important to you, please visit Nexus 4 support. Thank you for your patience.
